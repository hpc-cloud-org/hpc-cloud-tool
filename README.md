# HPC@Cloud Toolkit

This repository contains a dockerized environment and source code for the HPC@Cloud toolkit, comprised of a command-line interface for generating opinionated Terraform plans for Cloud HPC clusters. Currently AWS is fully supported by the CLI, and Vultr and IBM Cloud are partially supported through template HCL files.
